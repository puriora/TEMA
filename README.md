# EMA
English Multigram Analyzer. Coded in java.
This project seeks to research:

1. Are there patterns in how English words are constructed? If so, can the patterns be used to replicate the acceptability judgements of a native English Speaker?
2. Are there certain combinations of characters that give a word or a name certain impression? (i.e., are there patterns in female names that gives them a sense of femininity?)
3. Can low-order n-gram generative models capture English phonotactics, simply by the surface analysis of the characters instead of their underlying sounds? If so, how low can n go until the model fails?

Change the file path to the location of the /lib/.
Files titled "v1 plots" is a demo of the capabilities of the EMA. Plotting is done in python.
